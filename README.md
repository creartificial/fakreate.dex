# fakreate.dex

A Fakedex of Fakemons created by AI, imagined by human artists

# Shout-outs

The idea for this project was to use a concept like the one proposed [here](https://aiweirdness.com/post/159027130687/pokemon-generated-by-neural-network/amp) .

But instead of simply creating Pokémons names and abilities with AI, the idea was to add more information, 
basically all the information that can be found on a Pokédex entry for any given Pokémon.

Also, the following posts were really helpful for the model creation and training:

- [PyTorch LSTM: Text Generation Tutorial](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/07/pytorch-lstm-text-generation-tutorial.html)
