Though usually dim witted, it seems to become inspired if the SHELLDER on its tail bites down. If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harshbattle, it reverts to being an ordi  nary SLOWPOKE. Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead. Naturally dull to begin with, it lost its ability to feel pain due to SHELLDER’s seeping poison. It spaces out while gazing at the sea. With Shellder’s poison flowing through its body, it becomes even spacier. Lives lazily by the sea. If the Shellder on its tail comes off, it becomes a Slowpoke again. Its tail has a SHELLDER firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This forces it to reluctantly swim and catch prey. Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream. When a Slowpoke went hunting in the sea, its tail was bitten by a Shellder. That made it evolve into Slowbro. An attached SHELLDER won't let go because of thetasty flavor that oozes out of its tail. A Shellder bite set off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro’s body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pokémon. Lives lazily by the sea.

Scolipede engage in fierce territorial battles with Centiskorch. At the end of one of these battles, the victor makes a meal of the loser. Highly aggressive, it uses the claws near its neck to dig into its opponents and poison them. It clasps its prey with the claws on its neck until it stops moving. Then it finishes it off with deadly poison. With quick movements, it chases down its foes, attacking relentlessly with its horns until it prevails."

When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows moist and heavy, and it can’t move as well. When attacked, it escapes by shooting cotton from its body. The cotton serves as a decoy to distract the attacker. Weaving together the cotton of both Cottonee and Eldegoss produces exquisite cloth that’s highly prized by many luxury brands. When it finds others of its kind, they all stick together. When enough of them have collected, the mass resembles a cumulonimbus cloud. Perhaps because they feel more at ease in a group, they stick to others they find. They end up looking like a cloud. It shoots cotton from its body to protect itself. If it gets caught up in hurricane-strength winds, it can get sent to the other side of the Earth. Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled by Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy— altogether top quality. When attacked, it expels cotton from its body to create a diversion. The cotton it loses grows back in quickly. They go wherever the wind takes them. On rainy days, their bodies are heavier, so they take shelter beneath big trees."

These Pokémon sneak through gaps into houses and cause all sorts of mischief. As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it. This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes, where it hides important things and scatters cotton all over the place. Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It floats around on whirling winds, appearing all over the place to perform its mischief. It rides on the wind and slips into people’s homes. After it has turned a room into a cotton- filled mess, it giggles to itself and takes off. They appear along with whirlwinds. They pull pranks, such as moving furniture and leaving balls of cotton in homes. It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and have no choice but to answer for its mischief. This Pokémon appears, riding upon the wind.

The leaves on its head grow right back even if they fall out. These bitter leaves refresh those who eat them. The leaves on its head are very bitter. Eating one of these leaves is known to refresh a tired body. They prefer clean water and soil. When the environment they live in turns bad, the whole bunch will up and move to a new area. The deeper the color of a Petilil’s leaves, the healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed. Petilil appears around sources of clean water. Boiling leaves from this Pokémon’s head results in a liquid that’s sometimes used as a bug repellent. By pruning the leaves on its head with regularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a fine plump shape. Since they prefer moist, nutrient-rich soil, the areas where Petilil live are known to be good for growing plants. Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."

As soon as it finds a male to be its partner, the beautiful flower on its head darkens, droops, and withers away. Even veteran Trainers face a challenge in getting its beautiful flower to bloom. This Pokémon is popular with celebrities. The fragrance of its flower differs slightly depending on the soil where it grew up. Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind. The fragrance of the garland on its head has a relaxing effect. It withers if a Trainer does not take good care of it. Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers have a sublime scent, but they’re also staggeringly expensive.

Red and blue Basculin get along so poorly, they’ll start fighting instantly. These Pokémon are very hostile. Red and blue Basculin usually do not get along, but sometimes members of one school mingle with the other’s school. Blue-striped Basculin used to be a common food source. They apparently have an inoffensive, light flavor. In the past, it often appeared on the dinner table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth. Savage, violent Pokémon, red and blue Basculin are always fighting each other over territory. Known for their violence, these Pokémon have the most fights with schools of red- striped Basculin.

The sun-warmed sands prevent their body temperature from dropping. It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch. Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts. Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it’s swimming. Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.” It moves along below the sand’s surface, except for its nose and eyes. A dark membrane shields its eyes from the sun.

After clamping down with its powerful jaws, it twists its body around to rip its prey in half. Its unique faculty of sight can detect small prey more than 30 miles away, even in the midst of a sandstorm.

Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling. This Pokémon was born from a bag stuffed with trash. Galarian Weezing relish the fumes belched by Trubbish. The combination of garbage bags and industrial waste caused the chemical reaction that created this Pokémon.

It clenches opponents with its left arm and finishes them off with foul-smelling poison gas belched from its mouth. It sprays toxic gas from its mouth and fingers. If the gas engulfs you, the toxins will seep in all the way down to your bones. Consuming garbage makes new kinds of poison gases and liquids inside their bodies. For a time, their numbers increased explosively in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their population has decreased dramatically. Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy. It locks opponents in place with its left hand, immobilizing them by entirely dousing their bodies with poisonous liquid. This Pokémon eats trash, which turns into poison inside its body. The main component of the poison depends on what sort of trash was eaten. Beware the poisonous liquid it shoots from its right arm.

When Zorua does this, it usually takes on the form of a child. Zorua is a timid Pokémon. This disposition seems to be what led to the development of Zorua’s ability to take on the forms of other creatures. It changes into the forms of others to surprise them. Apparently, it often transforms into a silent child. It changes so it looks just like its foe, tricks it, and then uses that opportunity to flee. To protect themselves from danger, they hide their true identities by transforming into people and Pokémon. If a normally talkative child suddenly stops talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua. This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so when it’s not around friends, it basically always stays transformed as something else."

A clean freak that will not allow even the slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to thoroughly clean any and all filth. Minccino greet each other by grooming one another thoroughly with their tails. They pet each other with their tails as a form of greeting.

They will dig the whole night through. It excels at digging holes. Using its ears, it can dig a nest 33 feet deep in one night. It’s very sensitive to danger. The sound of Corviknight’s flapping will have Bunnelby digging a hole to hide underground in moments. It has ears like shovels. Digging holes strengthens its ears so much that they can sever thick roots effortlessly."

People used to make heavy winter clothing from fur shed by this Pokémon. With their powerful ears, they can heft boulders of a ton or more with ease. They can be a big help at construction sites. With power equal to an excavator, it can dig through dense bedrock. It’s a huge help during tunnel construction. As powerful as an excavator, its ears can reduce dense bedrock to rubble. When it’s finished digging, it lounges lazily."

This amiable Pokémon is easy to train. But when battle is joined, it shows its ferocious side. Its melodious cries are actually warnings. Fletchling will mercilessly peck at anything that enters its territory. When this Pokémon gets excited, its body temperature increases sharply. If you touch a Fletchling with bare hands, you might get burned. Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed. These friendly Pokémon send signals to one another with beautiful chirps and tail-feather movements. When it’s excited, its temperature can double, spiking hormone production in its body. Despite the beauty of its lilting voice, it’s merciless to intruders that enter its territory."
662,Fletchinder,fire,flying,flame-body,,gale-wings,Ember Pokémon,62,73,55,56,52,84,red,0.7,16.0,wings,,flying,,,False,"From its beak, it fires embers at its prey. Once it has caught them, it grills them at high heat before feasting upon them. Fletchinder launches embers into the den of its prey. When the prey comes leaping out, Fletchinder’s sharp talons finish it off. The hotter the flame sac on its belly, the faster it can fly, but it takes some time to get the fire going. Fletchinder are exceedingly territorial and aggressive. These Pokémon fight among themselves over feeding grounds. From its beak, it expels embers that set the tall grass on fire. Then it pounces on the bewildered prey that pop out of the grass. It scatters embers in the tall grass. Then bug Pokémon, frightened by the flames, come flying out, and Fletchinder gobbles them up. Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in the top speed class of all bird Pokémon. It will not tolerate other Fletchinder entering its territory, which has a radius of several miles."

Its favorite foods are Wingull and Pikipek. It attacks with a powerful kick and grasps them firmly in its talons. Talonflame dives toward prey at speeds of up to 310 mph and assaults them with powerful kicks, giving the prey no chance to escape. Its tough wings don’t allow fire to pass through them. A long time ago, firefighters’ outfits were made from Talonflame wings. When attacking prey, it can reach speeds of up to 310 mph. It finishes its prey off with a colossal kick. Talonflame mainly preys upon other bird Pokémon. To intimidate opponents, it sends embers spewing from gaps between its feathers. It zooms directly at its prey at flight speeds of close to 310 mph, while fiery embers scatter from gaps in its feathers. Bird Pokémon make up most of its diet. It approaches at high speeds and smacks them down to the ground with its powerful kick."

When predators attack, it quickly bristles the fur covering its body in an effort to threaten them. The beaks of bird Pokémon can’t begin to scratch its stalwart body.

This hot-blooded Pokémon is filled with curiosity. When it gets angry or starts fighting, its short mane gets hot. When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re kicked out and have to make their own way. They set off on their own from their pride and live by themselves to become stronger. These hot-blooded Pokémon are quick to fight."

This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat. The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride. The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety. With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger. The females protect the pride’s cubs."

Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties. When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on that flower its whole life long. It floats in the wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart. It draws out and controls the hidden power of flowers. The flower Flabébé holds is most likely part of its body."

It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle. It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed. It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains. When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance."

It controls the flowers it grows. The petal blizzards that Florges triggers are overwhelming in their beauty and power. It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants. Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said to devote its entire life to protecting gardens."

Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely. It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away. There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers. It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head. It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey. It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark. Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling. It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader."
675,Pangoro,fighting,dark,iron-fist,mold-breaker,scrappy,Daunting Pokémon,95,124,78,69,71,58,white,2.1,136.0,humanoid,,ground,humanshape,mental-herb,False,"It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take. Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole. Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies. It boasts superb physical strength. Those who wish to become Pangoro’s Trainer have no choice but to converse with their fists. Using its leaf, Pangoro can predict the moves of its opponents. It strikes with punches that can turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit. This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character. Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying. From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it deduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to tussle but kindhearted toward its companions. This Pokémon is quick to anger, and it has no problem using its prodigious strength to get its way. It lives for duels against Obstagoon."

There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style. Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon were the designated guardians of the king. Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."

Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power. It has enough psychic energy to blast everything within 300 feet of itself, but it has no control over its power. There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome."
678,Meowstic,psychic,,keen-eye,infiltrator,prankster,Constraint Pokémon,74,48,76,83,81,104,blue,0.6,8.5,upright,,ground,,,False,"Females are a bit more selfish and aggressive than males. If they don’t get what they want, they will torment you with their psychic abilities. The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense. When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust. The defensive instinct of the males is strong. It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their partners that they unleash their full power. Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally keeps the patterns hidden, however. If it doesn’t hold back when it unleashes its psychic power, it can tear apart a tanker. Its unfriendliness is part of its charm."
679,Honedge,steel,ghost,no-guard,,,Sword Pokémon,45,80,100,35,37,28,brown,0.8,2.0,blob,,mineral,,,False,"The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the true body of Honedge. With its old cloth, it drains people’s lives away. Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force. If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps a blue cloth around that person’s arm and drains that person’s life energy completely. Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who was killed a long time ago by the sword that makes up Honedge’s body."
680,Doublade,steel,ghost,no-guard,,,Sword Pokémon,59,110,150,45,49,35,brown,0.8,4.5,heads,,mineral,,,False,"The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay. The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey. When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons. Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents."
681,Aegislash,steel,ghost,stance-change,,,Royal Sword Pokémon,60,50,140,50,140,60,brown,1.7,53.0,blob,,mineral,,,False,"Its potent spectral powers allow it to manipulate others. It once used its powers to force people and Pokémon to build a kingdom to its liking. Once upon a time, a king with an Aegislash reigned over the land. His Pokémon eventually drained him of life, and his kingdom fell with him. Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king. This stance is dedicated to offense. It can cleave any opponent with the strength and weight of its steel blade. In this defensive stance, Aegislash uses its steel body and a force field of spectral power to reduce the damage of any attack. Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
682,Spritzee,fairy,,healer,,aroma-veil,Perfume Pokémon,78,52,60,63,65,23,pink,0.2,0.5,arms,,fairy,,,False,"The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for Spritzee. It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten. A scent pouch within this Pokémon’s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces. In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked."
683,Aromatisse,fairy,,healer,,aroma-veil,Fragrance Pokémon,101,72,72,99,89,29,pink,0.8,15.5,humanoid,,fairy,,,False,"The scents Aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight. Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it. It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle. The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell."
684,Swirlix,fairy,,sweet-veil,,unburden,Cotton Candy Pokémon,62,48,66,59,57,49,white,0.4,3.5,legs,,fairy,,,False,"Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy. The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies. To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy. It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy."
685,Slurpuff,fairy,,sweet-veil,,unburden,Meringue Pokémon,82,80,86,85,75,72,white,0.8,5.0,humanoid,,fairy,,,False,"Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks. Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose! It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work. By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications."
686,Inkay,dark,psychic,contrary,suction-cups,infiltrator,Revolving Pokémon,53,54,53,37,46,45,blue,0.4,3.5,tentacles,,water1,water2,,False,"Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight. It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place. It spins while making its luminescent spots flash. These spots allow it to communicate with others by using different patterns of light. When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm. It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent’s will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide. By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, Inkay demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee."
687,Malamar,dark,psychic,contrary,suction-cups,infiltrator,Overturning Pokémon,86,92,88,68,75,73,blue,1.5,47.0,blob,,water1,water2,,False,"When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds. It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids. It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants. It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp. It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events. Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer under Malamar’s control."
688,Binacle,rock,water,tough-claws,sniper,pickpocket,Two-Handed Pokémon,42,52,67,39,56,50,brown,0.5,31.0,heads,,water3,,,False,"They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline. After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide. If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive. Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock."
689,Barbaracle,rock,water,tough-claws,sniper,pickpocket,Collective Pokémon,72,105,115,54,86,68,brown,1.3,96.0,heads,,water3,,,False,"Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs. Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat. Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders. When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
690,Skrelp,poison,water,poison-point,poison-touch,adaptability,Mock Kelp Pokémon,50,60,60,60,60,30,brown,0.5,7.3,blob,,water1,dragon,,False,"It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source. Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off. It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution. Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies. It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise. It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."
691,Dragalge,poison,dragon,poison-point,poison-touch,adaptability,Mock Kelp Pokémon,65,75,90,97,123,44,brown,1.8,81.5,blob,,water1,dragon,,False,"Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory. Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of corroding metal to send tankers that enter its territory to the bottom of the sea. Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return. Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight. This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise. It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal."
692,Clauncher,water,,mega-launcher,,,Water Gun Pokémon,50,53,62,58,63,44,blue,0.5,8.3,armor,,water1,water3,,False,"By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies. Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious! Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar. They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol. It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight. Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock."
693,Clawitzer,water,,mega-launcher,,,Howitzer Pokémon,71,73,88,120,89,59,blue,1.3,35.3,squiggle,,water1,water3,,False,"Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker. Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls. Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient. By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots. It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron. After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target."

They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement. The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness. When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this Pokémon’s electric moves. The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
695,Heliolisk,electric,normal,dry-skin,sand-veil,solar-power,Generator Pokémon,62,55,52,109,94,109,yellow,1.0,21.0,upright,,monster,dragon,,False,"One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city. They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper. It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds. A now-vanished desert culture treasured these Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to the Galar region, treasure came with them."
696,Tyrunt,rock,dragon,strong-jaw,,sturdy,Royal Heir Pokémon,58,89,77,45,45,48,brown,0.8,26.0,upright,,monster,dragon,,False,"Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago. Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago. This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn’t like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild. Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured."

The king of the ancient world, it can easily crunch a car with the devastating strength of its enormous jaws. Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited. Nothing could stop this Pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king."
698,Amaura,rock,ice,refrigerate,,snow-warning,Tundra Pokémon,77,59,50,67,63,46,blue,1.3,25.2,quadruped,,monster,,,False,"It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky. Amaura was restored successfully, but it’s not expected to live long because of the heat of the current environment. This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum. This ancient Pokémon was restored from part of its body that had been frozen in ice for over 100 million years."
699,Aurorus,rock,ice,refrigerate,,snow-warning,Tundra Pokémon,123,77,72,99,92,58,blue,2.7,225.0,quadruped,,monster,,,False,"This usually quiet and kindly Pokémon has a surface temperature of around –240 degrees Fahrenheit. Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent’s attack. The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice.

Sylveon wraps its ribbonlike feelers around its Trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to read its Trainer’s feelings. There’s a Galarian fairy tale that describes a beautiful Sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon Pokémon. It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her. Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks. By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its ribbonlike feelers, Sylveon stops any conflict. It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights. When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces."

It’s also skilled at using superb submission holds. It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it’s using a special move and gets itself into a pinch. It always strikes a pose before going for its finishing move. Sometimes opponents take advantage of that time to counterattack."

Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs that shoot electricity. Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and receiving electrical waves, it can communicate with others over vast distances. It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal. A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another. Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric Pokémon."

Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels. It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found during the excavation of caves. Born from the temperatures and pressures deep underground, it fires beams from the stone in its head.

It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon. It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly. The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out. The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places. Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade. Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing. It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move. Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived."

Its entire body is covered with gooey mucus that can dissolve anything. Be sure to put gloves on if you’re going to touch it. It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything.

This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime. It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad. Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable. Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer. Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies’ attacks slide right off. It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail. It attacks with retractable horns.

It will sneak into people’s homes to steal their keys. Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys. It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys. Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki began appearing in human settlements. These key collectors threaten any attackers by fiercely jingling their keys at them. This Pokémon is constantly collecting keys. Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the Pokémon will protect them no matter what. Klefki sucks in metal ions with the horn topping its head. It seems this Pokémon loves keys so much that its head needed to look like one, too. It never lets go of a key that it likes, so people give it the keys to vaults and safes as a way to prevent crime."

With a voice like a human child’s, it cries out to lure adults deep into the forest, getting them lost among the trees. These Pokémon are created when spirits possess rotten tree stumps.

Using its roots as a nervous system, it controls the trees in the forest. It’s kind to the Pokémon that reside in its body. People fear it due to a belief that it devours any who try to cut down trees in its forest, but to the Pokémon it shares its woods with, it’s kind. It can control trees at will. It will trap people who harm the forest, so they can never leave. Small roots that extend from the tips of this Pokémon’s feet can tie into the trees of the forest and give Trevenant control over them. It’s feared as a ghost of the forest. Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest. Through its roots, it exerts control over other trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting down trees in forests where Trevenant dwell."

A large-sized Pumpkaboo evolves into a large-sized Gourgeist. Its bodily proportions also get passed on to its descendants. Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed. Supersized Gourgeist aren’t picky.

Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around. Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use. Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents. It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock! While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
738,Vikavolt,bug,electric,levitate,,,Stag Beetle Pokémon,77,70,90,145,75,43,blue,1.5,45.0,armor,,bug,,,False,"It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams. If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity. It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies. Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack. It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity. It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy."

When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints. It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious. Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it. Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches."

Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur. It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets. It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits! Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches."

You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen. Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’ movements and make fools of them. Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom. An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back. Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers."

When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still. It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used. It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row. Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements. It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle. Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen."

However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful! This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side. It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up. This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks. As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them. This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging."

Once a battle begins, however, this Pokémon displays a ferocious fighting spirit. When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer. The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off. With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots. It’s invigorated by powerful opponents—the stronger the better. A full-force headbutt from one of these Lycanroc can shatter giant boulders. Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons. This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks jutting from its mane are razor sharp. These Pokémon have both calm and ferocious qualities. Their temperamental nature makes them a difficult species to raise. The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms. This form of Lycanroc is reckless. It charges headlong at its opponents, attacking without any care about what injuries it might receive."
746,Wishiwashi,water,,schooling,,,Small Fry Pokémon,45,20,20,25,25,40,blue,0.2,0.3,fish,,water2,,,False,"Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents. When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather. It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson. They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school. When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away. On their own, they’re very weak. But when Wishiwashi pool their power together in a school, they become a demon of the sea. When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies.

It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon. They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off. The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin. It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles. Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."

To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet. Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect. Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake. Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects. With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."

If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer. It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine. Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud. It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping. Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine. The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait."

It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load. It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud. Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep. Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."

Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way. It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land. It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head. It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes. Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head. When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them."

A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors. As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon. It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby. For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals."

Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips. It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness.

Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve. This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes Salandit is there. Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home. It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them. Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas."

In fact, the giant was a Melmetal that was flooded with Gigantamax energy. Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years.

This Cramorant has accidentally gotten a Pikachu lodged in its gullet. Cramorant is choking a little, but it isn’t really bothered. It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight.
